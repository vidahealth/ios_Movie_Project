Welcome to CineCal, a movie app with only 10 movies!

This is a SwiftUI app, but you will be dealing mainly with MoviePickerVC, a UIViewController

Your tasks are as follows:

1. - Implement movie details using the focused movie provided by MovieCarouselDelegate.
You will display Title, Duration and Time

2. - Implement book button.
On clicking this button, a calendar sheet should appear, making a calendar event for the given movie at the specified time.
